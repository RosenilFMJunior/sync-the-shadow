SYNC | The Shadow 🌑
​"Everything in the universe is within you. Ask all from yourself." — Rumi
​SYNC is not a productivity tool. It is an existential paralyzer. In an age of relentless movement and curated individuality, this project offers the opposite: a confrontation with your own double through absolute stillness.
​👁️ The Concept
​This software uses computer vision to monitor your presence. It explores the limits of individuation. If you move, you affirm your "Ego" and shatter the mirror. If you become silent and still, the Shadow of the Relationship emerges.
​It is a digital tribute to the "Fiction of Unity"—the moment where two identical beings sit across from each other, waiting for a movement that never happens.
​How it works:
​The Mirroring: The app accesses your camera (locally; nothing is recorded or transmitted).
​The Vigilance: A frame-difference algorithm monitors every pixel for the slightest deviation.
​The Synchronicity: If you achieve a critical level of stillness, the central circle—the symbol of unity—will glow and breathe.
​The Rupture: Any gesture, any blink, and the connection dissolves. You are cast back into the noise of being "yourself."
​🛠️ Tech Stack
​Vanilla JavaScript: Pure logic, no unnecessary dependencies.
​Webcam API: To capture the reflection of the seeker.
​CSS3: For the "Rumi pulse" animation and minimalist void aesthetic.
